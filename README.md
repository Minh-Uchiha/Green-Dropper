# Green-Dropper

## About
This website gives users the ability to get information about the air quality of different areas around the world. Users can then choose a place they want to plant trees, 
based on the information about the air quality given to them earlier, and send a request to the organizations in charge of that place. It costs 1 dollar per tree.

## How I built it
I used different APIs to fetch the data of the geolocations and AQI of different places around the world. The front-end was built with React.js and the back-end was built 
with ASP.NET Core. The data of the user's credentials is stored in a SQL databse.
